To deploy Telegraf with OpenShift Monitoring, you will need to create the following files:

Telegraf configuration file: This file specifies the input and output plugins that Telegraf will use to collect and send metrics. Here is an example Telegraf configuration file that collects metrics from the OpenShift Prometheus server and sends them to the InfluxDB database used by OpenShift Monitoring:
Copy code
[[inputs.prometheus]]
  urls = ["http://prometheus-k8s.openshift-monitoring:9091"]

[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://influxdb-mon.openshift-monitoring:8086"]
  database = "telegraf"
DeploymentConfig file: This file specifies the details of the DeploymentConfig that will be used to deploy the Telegraf container on the OpenShift cluster. Here is an example DeploymentConfig file that deploys a Telegraf container using the configuration file above:
Copy code
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: telegraf
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: telegraf
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: telegraf
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: telegraf
        image: telegraf:latest
        volumeMounts:
        - name: telegraf-config
          mountPath: /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
          subPath: telegraf.conf
        env:
        - name: INFLUXDB_DATABASE
          value: "telegraf"
      volumes:
      - name: telegraf-config
        configMap:
          name: telegraf-config
ConfigMap file: This file specifies the configuration data that will be used by the DeploymentConfig to deploy the Telegraf container. In this case, the ConfigMap file will contain the Telegraf configuration file. Here is an example ConfigMap file that contains the Telegraf configuration file shown above:
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: telegraf-config
data:
  telegraf.conf: |
    [[inputs.prometheus]]
      urls = ["http://prometheus-k8s.openshift-monitoring:9091"]
    [[outputs.influxdb]]
      urls = ["http://influxdb-mon.openshift-monitoring:8086"]
      database = "telegraf"
To deploy Telegraf with OpenShift Monitoring, you will need to create these files and use the OpenShift CLI to apply them to the cluster. Once the DeploymentConfig and ConfigMap have been applied, the Telegraf container will be deployed on the cluster and will begin collecting and sending metrics to the OpenShift Monitoring stack.

Here is an example Telegraf configuration file that collects metrics from a Cisco Nexus series device using SNMPv2:

Copy code
[[inputs.snmp]]
  agents = [
    "udp:192.168.1.10:161"
  ]
  version = 2
  community = "public"
  name = "snmp_nexus"
  field_drop = ["ifHCInOctets_.*", "ifHCOutOctets_.*"]
  tag_keys = ["ifDescr"]
  metrics = [
    "ifInErrors",
    "ifOutErrors",
    "ifInDiscards",
    "ifOutDiscards"
  ]
In this configuration file, the inputs.snmp plugin is used to collect metrics from a Cisco Nexus device with an IP address of 192.168.1.10 using SNMPv2 and the community string public. The field_drop and metrics options are used to specify which metrics to collect from the device. The tag_keys option is used to specify the tags that should be applied to the collected metrics.

It is important to note that this configuration file is just an example, and you may need to adjust it to meet the specific requirements of your environment. For example, you may need to adjust the IP address of the Cisco Nexus device, the community string, or the metrics being collected.
